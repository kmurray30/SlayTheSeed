/**
 * Renders the Kaiser Crab boss — a SINGLE big Spine rig whose two targetable
 * arms (Crusher = left, Rocket = right) are driven on separate animation tracks,
 * exactly as the game does (see `NKaiserCrabBossBackground`: body idle on the
 * base track, `left/*` on track 1, `right/*` on track 2). The workbench used to
 * alias both arms to this rig and draw a whole crab PER arm; this draws it once.
 *
 * Idle: `body/idle_loop` (track 0) + `left/idle_loop` (track 1) +
 * `right/idle_loop` (track 2). A one-shot on an arm (`{nonce, clip}` for
 * `leftAction` / `rightAction`) plays `<side>/<clip>` on that arm's track, then
 * resumes that arm's idle (unless `hold`, e.g. death, which freezes the last
 * frame).
 *
 * SIZE AND PLACE. The crab is not fitted to a box: like every other creature it
 * is drawn at its authored scene scale (0.5 px per rig unit — `creature_scales`
 * `kaiser_crab`) with its ROOT on the combat scene's ground line, which is what
 * makes it 2765 x 1230 scene px, i.e. wider than the 1920 scene and most of its
 * height. That is the fight: the game mounts this rig on the combat-room
 * BACKGROUND and pulls the camera back to 0.75 (`KaiserCrabBoss`), so a claw
 * reaches in past each edge of the screen with the player standing between
 * them. Fitting it into the arena's box instead — which is what the workbench
 * did — produced a tidy little crab in the middle of the room.
 *
 * The canvas is placed relative to the rig ROOT (reported through `onMeasure`),
 * not centred in a box, so the parent can pin it to the ground line and pin
 * each arm's HP/intent overlay over the matching claw.
 *
 * Like SpineSprite, STS2 atlases are straight (non-premultiplied) alpha.
