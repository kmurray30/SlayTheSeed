/**
 * Bridges the sound context down to `AppBody`'s handlers, which sit OUTSIDE
 * `<SoundProvider>` — `AppBody` is the component that renders it, so it
 * can't call `useSound()` itself. `<SoundBridge>` is rendered as a child of
 * the provider and writes the live `sound` value into `soundRef` on every
 * render, the same way `Board.tsx` holds its own ref (see that component's
 * comment): `AppBody`'s card-play / map-select / map-open handlers read
 * `soundRef.current` rather than depending on the context value directly.
 *
 * It also owns the two run-level cues that are state TRANSITIONS rather than
 * a single handler call — gold gained and the run ending — as real effects,
 * for the same reason Board.tsx's combat diff is a real effect: they need to
 * react to `live` changing regardless of which of App's many code paths
 * changed it (a normal play, autobattle-mode autoplay, "play to end", …), not
 * just a handful of named button clicks.
 *
 * Per the sound/emit dependency rule (see Board.tsx): neither effect lists
 * `sound`/`emit` in its dependency array — each reads `soundRef.current`
 * (refreshed unconditionally above, every render) instead, so a volume tick
 * or the sfx map finishing its fetch never re-runs these.
