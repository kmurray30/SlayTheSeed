//! P9.0 vertical-slice integration test — bead `sts2-rs-vk9fz`.
//!
//! Exercises the wired pieces of the P9.0 thin slice in a single
//! end-to-end flow:
//!
//! - [`RunManager::new`] with `(seed, CharacterId::Ironclad)`
//!   (bead `sts2-rs-zfmfz` skeleton + `sts2-rs-jjcb8` starter pack).
//! - [`ActMap::linear_thin_slice`] start → Monster → Monster → Boss
//!   chain (bead `sts2-rs-5fsbh`).
//! - [`sts2_content::run_bridge::enter_combat`] +
//!   [`sts2_content::run_bridge::exit_combat`] for each room
//!   (bead `sts2-rs-tjn0v`), using
//!   [`sts2_core::encounters::act1_normal_pool`] for Monster rooms
//!   and [`sts2_core::encounters::act1_boss_pool`] for the Boss room
//!   (bead `sts2-rs-5mfyd`).
//!
//! ## Why this is not a true `take_action`-driven loop
//!
//! At this pin, [`RunManager::take_action`] is a skeleton that always
//! returns [`ActionResult::NotImplemented`]: the per-phase handlers
//! (MapChoice → Combat → CardReward → MapChoice → … → RunOver) have
//! not been ported yet — those land in subsequent P9.0/P9.1 phase
//! beads. The vertical slice this test gates is therefore the
//! *plumbing*: starter-pack init, map traversal, the combat bridge,
//! and HP write-back. The "play a random-action policy" form of the
//! gate will be retrofitted onto this test once `_enter_combat` /
//! `_enter_card_reward` / `_advance_map` phase handlers land.
//!
//! ## Determinism gate
//!
//! Two `RunManager`s built from the same `(seed, character)` must
//! land on byte-identical [`RunState`] (excluding the un-hashable
//! `BTreeMap` / multi-stream RNG bundle, which are compared via
//! their public scalar accessors) after walking the same 3-room
//! sequence. The simulated combats here are deterministic by
//! construction (no rolls; we just mutate `player.current_hp` to a
//! fixed value), so this gate is currently testing the bridge's
//! purity rather than RNG-stream isolation. The RNG-determinism
//! gate gets sharper when an actual rollout policy is wired.
