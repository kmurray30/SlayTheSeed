"""Tests for the opt-in ``played_save`` bootstrap on ``start_run``.

Context: real-game bridge parity gate (2026-07-11). A fresh headless save
(``played_save`` unset/False, the default) always opens act 1 on the Neow
blessing altar (``event_choice`` for "Neow") -- this matches a real
brand-new player's very first run, where NEOW_EPOCH has never been obtained.
A REAL save with many runs played can still be sitting on NEOW_EPOCH at
``EpochState.Obtained`` (earned) without ever being ``Revealed`` (the player
never clicked "Reveal" on the Timeline screen) -- and in that state, the game
skips the altar entirely and opens directly on ``map_select`` with a plain
10-card deck (no Neow relic/curse).

``played_save=True`` bootstraps exactly that minimal "obtained-not-revealed"
progress state (mirrors ``SaveManager.ResetTimelineProgress``'s own
``ObtainEpochOverride(NEOW_EPOCH, Obtained)`` call) before the run is created,
so headless reproduces it deterministically. See
``RunSimulator.BuildUnlockState``'s doc comment (C#) for the full mechanism
and the RNG-alignment pitfall it documents.

Verified against a real recorded trail: seed "12345" / Ironclad /
``played_save=True`` reproduces the live game's actual first map node
(col=3, row=0, Monster) and first combat (Twig Slime (S), Leaf Slime (M),
Leaf Slime (S), opening hand Strike/Defend/Defend/Strike/Strike) exactly --
see ``logs/realgame_parity/20260711T033316Z_seed12345/real.jsonl``.
