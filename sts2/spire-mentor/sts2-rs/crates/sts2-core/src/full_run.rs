//! Seeded full-run driver — the engine-level analog of the C# game's
//! `AutoSlay` harness.
//!
//! Bead `sts2-rs` (AutoSlay-inspired full-run fuzzer, B3/B4): the C#
//! `MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.AutoSlay` harness plays a whole seeded run with
//! uniform-random-but-legal actions, guarded by a watchdog, to surface
//! crashes/hangs. This is the headless engine-level version: it drives a
//! callback-wired [`RunManager`] through [`RunManager::get_available_actions`]
//! / [`RunManager::take_action`] picking actions from a pluggable
//! [`RunPolicy`], with a deterministic livelock detector (run-hash stall)
//! and a hard step cap in place of the C#'s real-time watchdog.
//!
//! The driver is **content-agnostic**: it drives whatever `RunManager`
//! it's handed. The caller wires the content layer (e.g.
//! `sts2_content::run_callbacks::new_run_manager_for_character_from_string_seed`)
//! before calling [`drive_full_run`]. This keeps the `content → core`
//! dependency direction intact, exactly like the PyO3 `random_playout`
//! convenience that this generalizes.
//!
//! ## Outcomes vs P9 gating
//!
//! Run-state porting (P9) is incomplete, so many [`RunAction`] variants
//! still route to [`ActionResult::NotImplemented`]. That is **not** a
//! crash — it's "this phase isn't ported yet", surfaced as
//! [`RunOutcome::NotImplemented`] (a clean stop). A genuine anomaly —
//! the engine *rejecting* an action that `get_available_actions` just
//! surfaced — is [`RunOutcome::Rejected`]. Crashes (panics) are caught
//! by the *caller's* sweep harness (see the `fuzz` CLI subcommand), not
//! here: the core driver stays panic-transparent so unit tests get clean
//! backtraces.
