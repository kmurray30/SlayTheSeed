//! AlphaZero M3, Task 2: run-draw stream-set membership tripwire ("Test #7").
//!
//! Closes half of bead `sts2-rs-0lr87` (the M2 final-review finding that the
//! run-draw RNG twin only covered `rewards`/`shops`/`transformations` and
//! was never checked against real map/treasure callbacks). Extends
//! [`sts2_core::run_rng_set::RunRngSet`]'s run-draw stream set to 5
//! (`rewards`, `shops`, `transformations`, `unknown_map_point`,
//! `treasure_room`) and proves — by driving REAL [`PlanningRun`] callbacks,
//! not synthetic pokes — that the aggregate fingerprint moves if and only if
//! one of the covered streams actually advanced.
