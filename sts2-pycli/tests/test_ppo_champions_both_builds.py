"""Every deployed champion plays a whole run on both game builds (GH #799).

The champions were re-exported over a vocab that spans v0.107.1 and v0.111.0
(`scripts/reexport_champions_vocab.py`). These drive the deployed run agent
(`sts2_rs.PpoRunAgent`: the champion for every meta decision, the combat MCTS
for every fight) through one complete run per character on each build, at a
tiny combat budget so the suite stays fast. The v0.111.0 seed's Neow offer
carries DowsingRod, so the net is shown a v0.111.0-only id, which must now
have a row of its own instead of OOV.

The full-budget smoke, with the per-run record, is
`scripts/smoke_v0111_champions.py`; bit-identity on v0.107.1 is
`scripts/vocab_reexport_equivalence.py`.
