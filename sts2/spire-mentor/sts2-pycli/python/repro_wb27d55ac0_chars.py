"""Scope check for wb-27d55ac0e5e1df7f: is the anti-upgraded enchant prior
Necrobinder-only, or does every deployed champion carry it?

Same instrument as `repro_wb27d55ac0.py`, reduced to the one paired
measurement that matters: a deck holding the SAME card twice, once base and
once upgraded, offered as a whole-deck ENCHANT. Under Perfect Fit / Adroit /
Sharp the upgraded copy is the strictly better target, so a champion that
ranks base above upgraded is wrong on this surface.

Run from sts2-pycli:  uv run python python/repro_wb27d55ac0_chars.py
