//! Combat pile-search / multi-pick / Discover-style choice resolution for
//! the **meta** policy (issue #164).
//!
//! The combat MCTS already searches these choices natively: a card's
//! `OnPlay` opens a `PendingChoice`, `legal_actions` fans it out into
//! single-index `ResolveChoice` actions (sequential decomposition, bead
//! `sts2-rs-sopgf`), and the search expands every branch. But when the
//! **meta** policy plays combat without the MCTS bridge — `--combat none`,
//! or the rare untranslatable-action fallback — it had no machinery for
//! these at all and blindly took option 0 (`heuristic.rs` `Phase::Combat
//! => 0`). First-option is actively bad here: for an exhaust/discard
//! choice it would dump whatever card sits first in hand (possibly your
//! best Attack), and for a Discover it would take an arbitrary generated
//! card.
//!
//! This module gives that path a competent greedy resolver. Each decision
//! is a single pick (the engine re-opens the choice after every
//! incremental selection), so greedy-per-pick is the natural fit — the
//! same shape as the shop knapsack (`surfaces::shop`) and exactly what
//! the issue's step 4 calls for. Scoring is direction-by-`ChoiceKind`:
//! "acquire / keep / draw" kinds want the **best** card, "exhaust /
//! discard / make-ethereal" kinds want the **worst**, and the do-nothing
//! FINALIZE option is the zero baseline — so a skippable removal only
//! fires on a genuinely dead card and never sheds a useful one.
//!
//! Honest-by-construction: any `ChoiceKind` whose desirable direction
//! isn't clearly card-value-shaped (orb slots, enemy targets, monster
//! curse picks, the character-specific transforms) returns `None` and the
//! caller falls back to first-option — never a regression vs. today.
