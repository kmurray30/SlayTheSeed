//! Intent-aware tactical scenario tests for bead `sts2-rs-n0gn`.
//!
//! These two scenarios were deliberately punted from `sts2-rs-v2oh`
//! because they require the search to (a) read enemy intent end-to-end
//! and (b) value the resulting damage / wasted-energy delta on the
//! continuous Q channel. With v2oh's lightspeed-style victory eval +
//! `2rp7`'s intent translation both landed, the contract is finally
//! expressible at the MCTS level — and these tests pin it.
//!
//! - **Scenario A — block when the enemy attacks for lethal-soon.**
//!   Player low HP, enemy telegraphing a big hit. Defending now keeps
//!   the player alive into next turn where the kill lands; attacking
//!   first eats the hit and risks death. MCTS must prefer Defend.
//!
//! - **Scenario B — skip blocking when the enemy is buffing.** Enemy
//!   intent is `Buff` (no incoming damage this turn). Defending wastes
//!   energy that should go into Strike — chip damage now strictly
//!   dominates. MCTS must prefer Strike.
//!
//! Sim budget: 1000 sims, 3 seeds — within the documented MCTS knee
//! (`docs/perf/...` / project memory: `sims=300–3000`) and matching
//! the budget the hint adapter actually uses in the CLI. Sweeping >1
//! seed defends against single-seed flakes the way `toy_convergence`
//! historically caught them.

// guaranteed win where Strike and Defend back up the same victory value
// (`evaluate_victory` counts HP/potions/round, not block), so their root
// visit counts tie and an `argmax(visits)` pick breaks the tie
// arbitrarily toward Defend even though Strike holds the (marginally)
// higher Q. Asserting on `search()`'s return keeps the test aligned with

///     Strike(6), Strike(6), Strike(6)]`.
///   - Enemy at 24 HP, intent `Attack { damage: 8 }` — exactly lethal
///     against an undefended 8-HP player.
///   - "2 turns to lethal" framing: enemy survives this turn (24 HP >
///     3×6 max strike), so the player has to live into a second turn
///     to finish the fight. With this fixture's empty draw pile that
///     second turn never produces cards, so the rollout depth-cuts
///     into v2oh's in-progress eval band (–0.5, 0.5) — exactly the
///     gradient v2oh added so MCTS can rank "alive when the timer
///     runs out" above "dead at the buzzer".
///   - Path A (Defend × 2 + Strike): blocks 10 ≥ 8 incoming → HP 8
///     held, enemy chipped to 18 — search returns to mid-game.
///   - Path B (Strike × 3): deals 18, takes 8 → dead this turn → Q
///     pinned at –1.0.
///
/// Expected: the action MCTS recommends (`search()`) is Defend (hand index
/// 0 or 1) across ≥2/3 seeds. The Q-gap here is large (≈ –1.0 vs a
/// non-trivial in-progress value), well within MCTS's resolution at
/// 1000 sims.
///
/// NOTE on enemy choice: the `build_handful_ex` fixture uses the
/// Nibbit stub. Per project memory `feedback_sts1_stubs_not_sts2`,
/// the species discriminant on this fixture is Phase-4 scaffolding;
/// we override its HP + intent directly and only the intent damage
/// drives behavior here — exactly what v2oh's intent translation
/// reads. TODO: switch to a wired STS2 enemy with a reliable
/// big-attack intent once one ships through the act1 registry
/// (tracked under `sts2-rs-ar9u`).
