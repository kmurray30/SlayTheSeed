"""C#↔Rust EVENT parity — the per-act event POOL and per-event OPTION lists.

Two complementary checks, both combat-free (no map walk, no winning combat —
so they cover ALL THREE ACTS, not just act 1, which the lockstep whole-run
sweep can only reach when random play happens to clear the bosses):

  POOL parity  — does each act's shuffled event pool (the `RoomSet.events`
    list, `(AllEvents ++ AllSharedEvents)` UnstableShuffled off the `up_front`
    stream in C# `ActModel.GenerateRooms`) match Rust's `events_shuffled`
    entry-for-entry, in order, across acts 1/2/3? This catches a wrong event
    set OR a wrong shuffle (RNG misalignment). Uses the headless `dump_rooms`
    command vs the PyO3 `generated_rooms()` accessor — both pre-generated at
    run start, no traversal needed.

  OPTION parity — for every event in the union of those pools, force the
    event on each engine and diff its presented options. C# side:
    `enter_room {type: event, event: <Id.Entry>}` (`RunSimulator.EnterRoomImpl`)
    → the `event_choice` decision view. Rust side: the new
    `RunManager.force_event(<python_name>)` + `event_option_infos()`. We
    compare, by option position:
      * OPTION COUNT                       (hard — a missing/extra option)
      * the ENABLED / locked vector        (hard — C# `is_locked` ⇔ Rust
                                            `!enabled`; a wrongly (un)locked
                                            option is a real divergence)
    and report, advisory-only:
      * option_id STRING drift             (Rust emits a short canonical
                                            `option_id` e.g. `REACH`; C# emits
                                            the loc-key tail `text_key` e.g.
                                            `REACH_INTO_THE_FLESH` — different
                                            id namespaces BY DESIGN, same as the
                                            accepted SelfHelpBook READ_PASSAGE
                                            case, so this never fails the run).

  EFFECT parity (``--effect``) — option count + enabled is necessary but not
    sufficient: a handler can present an identical menu while granting the wrong
    relic, no-opping a deck mutation, finishing a multi-page chain early, or
    skipping a nested combat. With ``--effect`` we additionally RESOLVE every
    option (one fresh forced entry per option) on both engines and diff the
    resulting state — relics, deck multiset, potions, gold, hp, the landed
    phase, and the multi-page follow-up option count. This is the check that
    catches the `sts2-rs-m3n0g` event-side stubs that `OPTION parity` is blind
    to. Combat-free, so it covers all three acts.
