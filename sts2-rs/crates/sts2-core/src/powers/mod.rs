// HAND-MAINTAINED — edit directly. Add a `pub mod` line for a new character.
//! Power discriminant + per-character listener bodies.
//!
//! `PowerKind` lives in `../power_ids_generated.rs` and is hand-maintained
//! against the v0.107.1 C# decompilation — 272 variants as of the assertion
//! at the bottom of this file. Bead sts2-rs-pmf (P6-1b) originally generated
//! *this* aggregator from `powers.toml` via a `scripts/regen-powers-mod.py`
//! that no longer exists; it was retired because a rerun re-added the
//! deliberately deleted `necrobinder` module and rewrote the variant-count
//! assertion from 272 back to the Python pin's 267, discarding the
//! provenance comments that justify every bump. `powers.toml` survives as a
//! provenance table (it lists each character's exclusive `PowerKind`s);
//! nothing reads it. Listener bodies (`on_card_played`,
//! `modify_damage_additive`, ...) live in per-character submodules below;
//! each downstream P6 pool bead (P6-3..P6-7) edits its own character file
//! without touching this aggregator.
//!
//! ## Variant history
//!
//! * Bead sts2-rs-5if (VTHIN-2): `Vulnerable`.
//! * Bead sts2-rs-6w8 (P2-2): the remaining "core" pipeline powers
//!   (Weak, Frail, Strength, Dexterity, Artifact, Intangible, Thorns,
//!   Poison, `FlameBarrier`).
//! * Bead sts2-rs-9v1 (P5-2): 22 monster-side variants.
//! * Bead sts2-rs-8c0 (P6-2): full enum auto-generated from the Python pin.
//! * Bead sts2-rs-pmf (P6-1b): per-character listener submodules + manifest.
//!
//! ## Aliases
//!
//! Python's `PowerId` enum has zero `ENEMY_`-prefixed members; owner side
//! is encoded by which creature owns the `Power` instance, not by a
//! discriminant variant. Block lives on `Creature.block` (no `BLOCK`
//! variant). See the historical notes in the commit log for `8c0`/`pmf`.

// silent (P6-4 `sts2-rs-l2c`) and defect (P6-5 `sts2-rs-l7s`) removed in
// GH #666. Both were scaffolds whose helpers the dispatcher was supposed to
// key on and never did: every function in them had zero callers outside its
// own file, and the only outside mentions were COMMENTS — several of them
// retractions saying the stub described the wrong mechanic. They were also
// a second, wrong source of truth (`blur_preserves_block` returned `false`
// while Blur was implemented and flashing), and they descended from
// `sts2-rl-agent@01c094d:sts2_env/powers/*.py`, which this repo no longer
// treats as authoritative. The listeners themselves live where they always
// did — the per-`PowerKind` match arms in `hooks.rs`.
//
// `ironclad` and `colorless` have no dead helpers. `regent` is the same
// vintage but is NOT a scaffold: 15 of its functions are called from
// `hooks.rs`, `lib.rs` and `state_dict.rs`. Its ~21 unreferenced helpers are
// left for a decision of their own.
