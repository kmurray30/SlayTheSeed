"""Hand-written notes about non-obvious card mechanics.

These are derived from reading the decompiled source code and comparing
against the localized descriptions. They document behaviors that a player
might not expect from reading the card text alone.

Notes should NOT duplicate information already shown on the card page
(e.g., upgrade effects that appear in the Upgraded section).
