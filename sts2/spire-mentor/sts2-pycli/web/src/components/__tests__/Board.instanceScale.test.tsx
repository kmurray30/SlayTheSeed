/**
 * `NCombatRoom.RandomizeEnemyScalesAndHues` sizes every member of a group of
 * two or more monsters of one type by where its rolled max HP landed in that
 * monster's initial-HP band, so three Exoskeletons at 26/24/25 HP are three
 * visibly different sizes in the game. The board drew them as identical clones.
 *
 * The multiplier is computed server-side (it needs the HP band, which no wire
 * carries) and arrives as `size_jitter`. What is pinned here is that the DRAWN
 * rig takes it and the ROW does not: the game scales the creature only after
 * `PositionEnemies` has spaced the row by the authored `Visuals.Bounds`, so a
 * bigger instance must not push its neighbours along.
