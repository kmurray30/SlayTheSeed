// SimAgentGate.cs -- blocking "ask the agent, never guess" helper.

// New file, not present in the donor (zhiyue/sts2-rl-agent bridge_mod). The
// donor fell back to *random* play after a 30s agent timeout or when no
// client was connected -- this consumes game RNG and silently perturbs
// determinism/parity. Required deviation #3 in the bridge plan explicitly
// forbids that for SpireMentor: every handler that used to do
// `random.NextItem(options)` on a timeout/disconnect now instead calls
// through this gate, which blocks (waiting for a client to connect, then for
// a correlated response) until the agent actually answers. It never invents
// a choice on the mod's own initiative.
//
// agent_timeout_seconds (SimConfig) is *not* a give-up timeout: it only
// controls how often we re-poll/re-log while waiting (0 = one indefinite
// wait). On expiry we log and loop again rather than falling back.
