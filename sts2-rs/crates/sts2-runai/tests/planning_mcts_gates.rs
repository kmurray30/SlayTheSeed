//! AlphaZero M3, Task 6: integration-level test gate suite for the
//! run-level outer-loop MCTS (`sts2_runai::planning_mcts`).
//!
//! Integration tests only see the crate's PUBLIC surface — the
//! `#[cfg(test)]`-gated `StubLeafEval`/`FnLeafEval`/`StubSurrogate`/
//! `fresh_ironclad_run` fixtures in `planning.rs`/`planning_mcts.rs` are
//! `pub(crate)` and invisible here, so this file defines its own local
//! `Stub` surrogate and leaf evals, mirroring `planning_full_run.rs` and
//! `planning_run_draw_streams.rs` exactly (same fresh-Ironclad-run
//! construction via the public `sts2_content::run_callbacks` API).
//!
//! Four gates, matching
//! `docs/plans/2026-07-02-alphazero-m3-outer-loop-mcts-design.md` §8:
//!
//! - **Gate A** — determinism: two `search()` calls, same config, same
//!   action.
//! - **Gate B** — terminal backup: an always-lose surrogate drives a
//!   combat-entering action to a deterministic loss; the search must back
//!   up `0.0` for that action's root child, NOT the (deliberately high)
//!   leaf-eval constant — proving `RunOver` short-circuits `RunLeafEval`.
//! - **Gate C** — value-steering: a root with 2 legal actions (the
//!   post-Neow relic-reward decision, `[PickRelicReward, SkipRelic]`) and a
//!   leaf that scores low/high by a run-state predicate (`relics.len()`
//!   changed). Proven non-vacuous by *flipping* which side is low/high and
//!   showing the chosen action flips too — the steering is causal, not
//!   coincidental.
//! - **Gate D** — budget: `search()` returns a legal root action for a
//!   small simulation budget and returns promptly (no hang).
