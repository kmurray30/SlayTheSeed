//! Every monster-AI move state the engine can log must resolve to exactly
//! one row of the committed VFX binding table — or be listed as a known
//! exemption.
//!
//! This exists because the two id spaces are NOT the same. C# declares
//! `new MoveState("THRASH_MOVE", ThrashMove, …)`; `create_crusher_ai()` uses
//! `"THRASH"`. Stripping the `_MOVE` suffix reconciles Crusher — but design
//! spec §1.6 flagged that as *unverified* for the other ~95 monsters. This
//! test is what turned the assumption into a checked fact. Full findings are
//! in spec §1.6 and `task-7-report.md`; the short version is three distinct
//! hazards, not one:
//!
//! 1. The `_MOVE`-suffix convention itself is bidirectional — see
//!    [`candidate_keys`]. Mechanical, no per-monster list needed.
//! 2. 18 state-alias entries, across 13 distinct monster files, spell
//!    their engine id as a genuine RENAME of the C# id (not a suffix
//!    difference) — [`Aliases`], published in the table itself.
//! 3. A few Rust `MonsterKind` variants model a C# subclass or a
//!    positional/slot variant whose move-state machine actually lives in a
//!    DIFFERENT C# class (inheritance, or straight reuse) — [`Aliases`],
//!    published in the table itself.
//!
//! `vfx_bindings.py`'s module docstring is explicit that the extractor does
//! **not** do `_MOVE`-suffix reconciliation — it stores the C# state id
//! verbatim, and "that reconciliation belongs to whatever consumes this
//! table, not to extraction." This file is that consumer, so hazards 1-3
//! live here, not in the Python extractor. (One genuine extractor bug
//! *was* found along the way — a nested-path `WithHitFx` site on
//! `VineShambler` — and that one WAS fixed in `vfx_bindings.py`, per the
//! brief's first-preference response; see its commit.)

///    reconciliation in (1) does not apply, for one of two underlying
///    reasons (both confirmed by reading the C# `MoveState(...)`
///    constructor directly, not inferred from the id's shape):
///    - The Rust factory did NOT strip anything — its own id already
///      carries `_MOVE` (or `_MOVE_2`, `_MOVE_1`, …), matching C# exactly
///      (e.g. `Aeonglass:EBB_MOVE`, `Queen:ENRAGE_MOVE`,
///      `HunterKiller:BITE_MOVE`). Appending a second `_MOVE` here would
///      only ever break the join.
///    - C# itself never used the `_MOVE` suffix for this state at all
///      (e.g. `AxeRubyRaider.cs` declares `"SWING_1"`, `"BIG_SWING"` —
///      no suffix anywhere), and the Rust factory carries the identical
///      bare id.
///
/// Both branches of (2) collapse to the same lookup ("try the bare id"),
/// so this is one mechanical two-candidate rule rather than a per-monster
/// special case — an explicit alias list keyed on every affected monster
/// was tried first and rejected: it grew to ~55 entries with no rule other
/// than "the bare id already matches", which is exactly what trying
/// candidate (2) directly gives for free, with no invented casing step
/// (contrast the published state aliases, which stay a hand list because
/// those entries are genuine renames with no shared rule at all).
