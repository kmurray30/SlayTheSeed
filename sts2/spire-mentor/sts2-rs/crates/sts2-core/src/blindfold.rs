//! Root blindfold for honest-search combat MCTS.
//!
//! Bead `sts2-rs-vqckz` (F0, plan §3.1/§3.4 of
//! `docs/plans/2026-07-12-clairvoyance-removal-plan.md`). The deployed
//! chance-node MCTS reads two pieces of hidden information a player
//! cannot observe: the true materialized draw-pile order (draws consume
//! no RNG, so they never trip the stochastic detector) and the true RNG
//! stream cursors (chance outcome 0 realizes from them). [`blindfold_root`]
//! replaces both with a fresh sample that depends **only** on a caller
//! supplied seed — never on the incoming hidden state — so a search that
//! blindfolds its root before searching is, by construction, invariant to
//! information the player never had.
//!
//! ## Canonicalization: why sort-then-shuffle
//!
//! A plain seeded shuffle of the *incoming* pile order is not enough. Two
//! permutations `P1` and `P2` of the same multiset are different inputs to
//! a shuffle — `shuffle(P1, seed)` and `shuffle(P2, seed)` land on
//! different output permutations even though `P1` and `P2` carry the same
//! observable information (a player only tracks which cards are where,
//! not the "hidden" incoming order the search happens to start from — that
//! order is itself a leak). To make the result a pure function of `seed`
//! (and the card multiset / pins, which ARE observable), the unknown
//! portion is first sorted into a canonical order — any deterministic
//! total order on [`crate::CardUid`] works, since the UIDs are unique so
//! the sorted sequence is the same regardless of which permutation of the
//! multiset was the input — and *then* shuffled with an RNG seeded purely
//! from the caller's seed. Two states differing only in unknown-pile order
//! collapse to byte-identical piles after this pipeline.
//!
//! Pinned positions ([`crate::PlayerCombatState::pinned_top`] /
//! `pinned_bottom`) are player-KNOWN information (Headbutt etc.) and are
//! preserved exactly like [`crate::cards::shuffle`] preserves them — the
//! canonicalization sort only touches the same unpinned middle segment
//! that the shuffle permutes.
//!
//! ## What is NOT touched
//!
//! `discard` / `exhaust` / `play` are face-up, publicly observable piles
//! — scrambling them would erase real information the player has and
//! isn't part of the leak. Only the unknown draw-pile segment and the RNG
//! streams are hidden information.
