//! The `sts2-cli` scenario builder's monsters as they were before GH #762, for
//! the benchmark harnesses' `--legacy-spawn` flag. Included with
//! `#[path = "common/legacy_spawn.rs"] mod legacy_spawn;`.
//!
//! The 2026-10-14 site numbers (`docs/perf/2026-10-14-site-performance.md`)
//! were measured on that builder, and the site and the bench scripts reproduce
//! them with `--legacy-spawn`. The builder now spawns monsters the way a run
//! does (`sts2_content::run_bridge::spawn_roster`), so this module rebuilds the
//! old start state on top of it. Never use it for anything but reproducing
//! those numbers: every fight it builds is unfaithful.

/// * every monster's AI built at `SpawnPosition.index` 0, front unless the
///   spec's `ai_args` say otherwise, with no spawn args except Nibbit's;
/// * HP rolled per monster, in order and without uniqueness, off
///   `Rng::new(seed)`, which also becomes the legacy combat RNG at the cursor
///   those rolls leave it at;
/// * the `niche` stream unread.

/// The rest is already as it was. Act 1 has no monster that debuffs the
/// player on spawn, and the player's mirror creature, now wired by the
/// builder rather than by `start_combat`, gets the same id and the same
/// values either way.
