//! `PowerFlashed` emission for `Hook.AfterModifyingDamageAmount` — the three
//! sites GH #635 landed: `HardToKillPower.cs:23`, `IntangiblePower.cs:61` and
//! `SlowPower.cs:48`.
//!
//! All three C# arms are a bare `Flash()` with no guard of their own. Every
//! condition lives in WHICH listeners `Hook.ModifyDamage` reports as having
//! moved the number (`Hook.cs:2655-2702`), which is why the negative halves
//! below are the substance of this file rather than its padding: a flash wired
//! to fire whenever the power exists passes every positive assertion here.
//!
//! Separate from `power_flash.rs` because these are driven through the real
//! damage pipeline rather than through a single dispatcher call — the selection
//! rule is a property of the pipeline, not of an arm.
