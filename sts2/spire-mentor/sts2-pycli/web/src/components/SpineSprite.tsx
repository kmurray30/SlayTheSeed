/**
 * Renders a live Spine rig (the real in-game character) into a WebGL canvas,
 * looping `animation` (default idle). Falls back to a static image while loading
 * or if WebGL / the rig fails. STS2 atlases are straight (non-premultiplied)
 * alpha, so we render with premultipliedAlpha=false (else region edges halo).
 *
 * `rigBase` is the URL base without extension; we append .skel/.atlas/.png.
 *
 * Proportions: every combatant (player + enemies) is rendered at
 * `worldScale * pxPerScene` pixels per rig-unit, where `worldScale` is the
 * creature's authored SCENE scale (e.g. Ironclad 0.28, Nibbit 0.28 but a much
 * smaller rig, Defect 0.125) and `pxPerScene` maps the game's 1920x1080 scene
 * onto the box we actually got (see src/scene.ts). That product is the game's
 * own sizing rule, not an approximation of it: the authored scale IS pixels per
 * rig unit in the game's scene, so a rig drawn this way is the size the game
 * draws it, and every creature is to scale against every other. The rigs are
 * authored already facing the player (the game never flips them), so we don't
 * flip either.
 *
 * Framing: the canvas is sized to *contain* the whole idle body (width too, so
 * wide monsters' tails aren't clipped) plus an overscan margin for the attack
 * lunge / raised weapon, bottom-anchored at the feet so it doesn't cover the
 * HP bar below.
 *
 * One-shot actions: when `actionNonce` changes, `actionAnim` (e.g. "attack",
 * "hurt") plays once, then idle resumes.
