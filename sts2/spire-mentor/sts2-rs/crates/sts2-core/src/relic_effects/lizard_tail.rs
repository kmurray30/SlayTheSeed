//! LizardTail — one-shot death-prevention revive.
use super::prelude::*;

/// `LizardTail.should_die_late` + `after_preventing_death` — when the
/// player would die and the relic is still armed, consume it and
/// revive at 50% max HP. Per C# canon
/// `MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.Models.Relics/LizardTail.cs`:
///
/// ```text
/// ShouldDieLate(creature):
///     return creature != Owner.Creature || WasUsed   // true = die
/// AfterPreventingDeath(creature):
///     WasUsed = true
///     amount = Math.Max(1m, MaxHp * (Heal(50) / 100m))
///     CreatureCmd.Heal(creature, amount)
/// ```
///
/// The Rust channel merges the veto + heal into one listener (the
/// dispatcher treats `Resolved` as the prevent vote and re-checks
/// `current_hp > 0` afterwards — see
/// [`crate::relic_effects::dispatch_should_die_late`]). C# clamps HP
/// at 0 on damage (`Creature.cs:450`) and `HealInternal` truncates the
/// decimal sum (`Creature.cs:488-490`), so the post-revive HP is
/// `max(1, floor(MaxHp / 2))` — same integer shape as the
/// FairyInABottle revive in
/// `combat_loop::try_fairy_in_a_bottle_prevent_death` (30% → 50%).
///
/// One-shot state lives on `Relic.counter` (0 = armed, 1 = consumed —
/// C# `WasUsed` is a run-persistent `[SavedProperty]`, mirrored
/// run-side through the `enter_combat`/`exit_combat` counter bridge,
/// bead `sts2-rs-pfiwm`). Unlike RuinedHelmet there is NO
/// `after_combat_end` reset: the relic stays spent for the rest of
/// the run.
