"""Regenerate the champion regions the manifest cannot be read from directly.

``sts2-pycli/data/ppo/champions.toml`` is the source of truth, and Python reads
it at runtime. Two consumers cannot:

* ``sts2-rs/crates/sts2-runai/src/ppo/net.rs`` — the crate is built from
  standalone worktrees where no sibling ``sts2-pycli/`` exists (its own resolver
  already guards with ``sibling.exists()``), so a ``build.rs`` that
  ``include_str!``\\ 'd the manifest would make those worktrees unbuildable.
* ``./Dockerfile`` — ``COPY`` is Dockerfile syntax; it cannot read a file.

So both carry a GENERATED region between markers, rewritten from the manifest by
this script. ``--check`` byte-compares instead of writing, which is the gate:
it does not ask "did you remember to update the other lists", it asks "does this
match what the generator produces", and forgetting cannot pass that.

Usage:
    python scripts/sync_champions.py            # rewrite both regions
    python scripts/sync_champions.py --check    # fail if either is stale

    """`text` as `rustfmt` would write it, or unchanged if rustfmt is absent.

    The generator emits one match arm per line, which was identical to
    rustfmt's own output for as long as every arm fit inside the line width.
    Ironclad's arm stopped fitting when GH #545 gave it a non-empty feature
    spec (`"reward_upgrade"`), and the two gates then disagreed FOREVER:
    `cargo fmt --check` demanded the arm wrapped across four lines, while this
    script's `--check` demanded the one-line form it generates. Committing
    either one failed the other. Normalising through rustfmt here means the
    comparison is against what will actually sit in the file, so the two gates
    cannot diverge again the next time an arm crosses the width.

    Absent rustfmt degrades to the raw text rather than failing: the sync is
    useful without it (this is a formatting normalisation, not a correctness
    one), and `cargo fmt --check` is the gate that would catch the difference.

    "Cannot diverge again" is only true while this call and `cargo fmt` read
    the SAME config, which is why `--config-path` is passed: without it
    rustfmt searches upward from the cwd (there is no input file here — the
    text arrives on stdin), so it agreed with the workspace only incidentally.
    `max_width` happens to equal rustfmt's default today, so nothing was
    visibly broken; the first `sts2-rs/rustfmt.toml` edit that changes a
    width-affecting option would have re-opened the exact deadlock this
    function was written to close.
