"""The run driver the workbench live session is built on.

A :class:`GameBackend` owns one run being driven — it starts the run, applies
one verb at a time and renders the C# state-dict shape keyed by ``decision``
that the server / render / diff layers consume. :class:`BranchingLiveSession`
talks to this surface and nothing else, so the session never has to ask a
backend *what it is* — every optional capability has an honest default.

Four adapters satisfy the interface today:

* :class:`workbench.backends.rust_game.RustGame` — the in-process ``sts2_rs``
  engine. The only adapter with a native run (:meth:`GameBackend.native_run`),
  which is what run-mode autoplay, the PPO panels and the advisors need.
* :class:`workbench.backends.combat_replay.CombatReplayBackend` — one recorded
  combat replayed to an exact decision ("play from here"). Combat only.
* :class:`workbench.backends.imported_combat.ImportedCombatBackend` — one
  combat rebuilt from a board copied out of the live game. Combat only; it
  shares everything but its materialization with the replay adapter (see
  :class:`workbench.backends.single_combat.SingleCombatBackend`).
* :class:`DuckTypedBackend` — any object that speaks the five C# verbs
  (``sts2_client.Game``, the test fakes). It has none of the optional
  capabilities, and says so through the defaults rather than by lacking
  attributes.
