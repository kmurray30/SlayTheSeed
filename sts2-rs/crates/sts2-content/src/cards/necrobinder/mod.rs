//! Per-card module aggregator (Necrobinder). Rebuilt from scratch (C#-first) via
//! the character-port skill's dynamic workflow. ALL 88 cards of the C# pool are
//! now wired, in `GenerateAllCards()` (alphabetical) order. Some
//! wired cards apply powers whose listeners are not built yet — the card plays
//! and is faithful on its direct effect, but the power is currently inert (the
//! remaining power-listener bodies are the follow-up Necrobinder powers bead).
//! The Osty pet system IS wired (summon_osty / kill_osty / DieForYou redirect),
//! so the Osty cards (Bone Shards, Poke, Unleash, Sic Em, Dirge) and the Osty-
//! summon powers (SicEmPower / DevourLifePower) are live.
//! NECROBINDER_SPECS in spec_index.rs is kept in C# `GenerateAllCards()` order.
