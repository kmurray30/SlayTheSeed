//! Potion headroom ablations (`STS2_RUNAI_POTION_ABLATION`).
//!
//! Both the OC charge and the swap rule measured ≈0–1.5pp, none of it
//! significant. Before spending more on potion *policy*, these two seams
//! bound what potion policy can be worth at all:
//!
//! - `no-drinks` — the search may never take a `DrinkPotion` at the root,
//!   for every fight of the run. Baseline − this arm = **the total value
//!   of the whole potion system** to the agent (the denominator every
//!   potion result should be read against).
//! - `boss-oracle` — every boss fight is entered with a FULL belt, free.
//!   Baseline vs this arm = the **upper bound on all acquisition work**
//!   (skip / discard / swap / shop-buy combined): if perfect availability
//!   is worth little, that whole line is dead without building it.
//!
//! Measurement-only seams: like the other potion env vars they PANIC on
//! an unknown value rather than silently running an unablated arm.
//!
//! Known bias, deliberately accepted (`no-drinks`): held potions are
//! still acquired, so gold spent on shop potions is wasted in that arm,
//! which can only make the potion system look MORE valuable than it is.
//! The expected finding (small value) is therefore robust to it; a large
//! reading would need this refined before it could be trusted.
//!
//! `boss-oracle` fills with the GAME's own drop distribution — rarity
//! rolled 65% common / 25% uncommon / 10% rare, then uniform within the
//! class, mirroring `sts2_content::potions::all::create_random_potions_
//! from_pool` — off a deterministic per-(seed, floor) `splitmix64`
//! stream. It does NOT touch any engine RNG stream, so the rest of the
//! run is unperturbed and the arm is reproducible. The belt is therefore
//! "what the acquisition stream actually offers", not "the best
//! potions": this bounds perfect *availability*, not perfect
//! *selection*.
//!
//! (The first cut drew uniformly over common+uncommon only. That
//! over-sampled uncommons ~50/50 against the real 72/28 while dropping
//! rares entirely — two opposite biases of similar size. Matching the
//! real table removes the question instead of arguing it cancels.)
