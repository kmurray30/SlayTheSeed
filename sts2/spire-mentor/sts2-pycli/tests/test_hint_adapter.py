"""Tests for ``sts2_hint.adapter`` (bead sts2-rs-lv9d).

Fixture-driven tests exercising every adapter path enumerated in the
plan's hint-T7 acceptance row:

* Ironclad vs Nibbit mid-turn (canonical happy path)
* Silent vs Nibbits mid-turn
* hand-with-status (Burn)
* hand-with-curse
* multi-enemy intent
* mid-turn with player powers
* mid-turn with potions
* post-relic-trigger
* Defect orbs
* Necrobinder Osty

Each fixture either translates cleanly OR raises
:class:`sts2_hint.errors.UnsupportedStateError` with a specific
``<path>`` annotated. Both cases are tested.
