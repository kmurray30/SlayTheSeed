//! AlphaZero M2, Task 7: full-run fast-forward integration test.
//!
//! End-to-end proof that a [`PlanningRun`] driven by a trivial "always take
//! the first legal action" policy reaches `Phase::RunOver` in bounded steps
//! without ever surfacing `Phase::Combat` to the caller — every fight is
//! fast-forwarded through the [`CombatSurrogate`] seam (Tasks 2/5/6). A
//! `win_prob = 1.0` stub must ride the run all the way to a win (or at
//! least never lose); a `win_prob = 0.0` stub must die at the very first
//! combat entry.
//!
//! Uses the same fresh-Ironclad-run construction as the M1 harvest binary
//! (`crates/sts2-cli/src/bin/combat_surrogate_data.rs:258-260`) and the
//! `#[cfg(test)]` `fresh_ironclad_run` helper in `planning.rs` — that
//! helper isn't visible here (it's private to the unit-test module inside
//! the crate), so this integration test rebuilds the same sequence against
//! the public `sts2_content::run_callbacks` API.
